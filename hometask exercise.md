## Add new nodes
New nodes, for example, can be added to the navigation tree in order to add either a category, a fluorinated gas (Fgas), a fuel, a livestock type, or a subdivision in the LULUCF sector.

User-defined items can be added for:
   * Categories indicated as "Other (please specify)"
   * LULUCF subdivision
   * User-defined fuels

To add a new child node (both for a pre-defined or a user-defined item), follow the steps below:
1. Right click the parent node.
2. Select **Add new child node**.

**_Note:_** Only user-added nodes can be deleted. 

To delete a node, follow the steps below:
1. Right click the node.
2. Select **Delete child node**.

**_Warning:_** 

When deleting user-defined nodes, delete each child node first. Then, delete the parent node that was added. If a user deletes the parent node before the child nodes, an error message is shown. The nodes will then disappear from the tree. But the nodes are not removed from the database. So the user must click **Reload grid** icon at the bottom of the navigation tree.

After doing so, the child nodes will reappear on the tree. Any data in the grid for the user-added nodes is also deleted from the database when the nodes are removed.
