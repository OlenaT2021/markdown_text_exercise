# About Agile

Agile is an approach to project management that centers around incremental and iterative steps to completing projects. The incremental parts of a project are carried out in short-term development cycles. The approach prioritizes quick delivery, adapting to change, and collaboration rather than top-down management and following a set plan.
In the Agile process, there is continuous feedback, allowing team members to adjust to challenges as they arise and stakeholders an opportunity to communicate consistently. Though originally created for software development, the Agile approach is now widely used in executing many different types of projects and in running organizations.
Contrast this with any traditional method of project management. Traditional project management generally progresses linearly through planning, designing, implementation, and closing stages. One stage must be completed before moving to the next one.

## Key takeaways
Developing an Agile methodology can help reduce the risk of project failure by collecting frequent feedback from customers helps ensure that new features are consistently meeting customer expectations for quality and value.

The difference between the Waterfall and Agile methodology is that Waterfall projects are plan-driven while Agile projects are customer-driven.

The original authors of the Agile Manifesto identified four values central to the Agile methodology.

Sumo Logic supports development with the Agile methodology.


## Why Agile is used?
* Creating Tangible Value: Agile places a high priority on creating tangible value as soon as possible in a project. Customers can benefit from early delivery of promised advantages and opportunity for prompt feedback and modifications.

* Concentrate on Value-Added Work: Agile methodology promotes teams to concentrate on producing functional and value-added product increments, hence reducing the amount of time and energy allocated to non-essential tasks.

* Agile as a Mindset: Agile represents a shift in culture that values adaptability, collaboration, and client happiness. It gives team members more authority and promotes a cooperative and upbeat work atmosphere.

* Quick Response to Change: Agile fosters a culture that allows teams to respond swiftly to constantly shifting priorities and requirements. This adaptability is particularly useful in sectors of the economy or technology that experience fast changes.

* Regular Demonstrations: Agile techniques place a strong emphasis on regular demonstrations of project progress. Stakeholders may clearly see the projectâ€™s status, upcoming problems, and upcoming new features due to this transparency.

* Cross-Functional Teams: Agile fosters self-organizing, cross-functional teams that share information effectively, communicate more effectively and feel more like a unit.
